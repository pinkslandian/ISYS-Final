             Summary: <br>
           Archie Andrews starts the school year with the world weighing on his shoulders. 
           He's decided he wants to pursue a future in the music business, but his recently ended 
           clandestine relationship with the music teacher has left him without a mentor, and his 
           friendship with Jughead Jones is in a bad place. Things look like they might be turning
            around when Veronica Lodge, a new girl, arrives. Despite the instant chemistry, Veronica 
            is hesitant to risk a friendship with Betty -- who has a crush on Archie -- to pursue anything.
             Amidst all the small-town banality lurks a mystery: the recent tragic death of Jason Blossom, 
             the twin brother of beautiful and popular troublemaker, Cheryl. </p>
